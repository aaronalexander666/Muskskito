# ⚔️ Muskskito: The Sovereign Gateway – Built by the Free, for the Free.

**Muskskito is an open-source, disposable AI browser built to end digital feudalism.**

Every line of code is a commitment to self-custody. We are not a corporation, and this is not a product—it is the **Sovereign Gateway**, and it is being constructed by the global collective. If you believe your data belongs to you, join us.

## 🏛️ The Mission: Ending Digital Feudalism

The current internet is a surveillance platform. Muskskito is the counter-protocol. Our design philosophy is simple: **Browse Safe, Leave No Trace.**

We eliminate persistence, integrate on-device AI for defense, and ensure that every session is an ephemeral fortress that burns itself down upon exit. We are building the internet's **Djed Pillar**—stable, immutable, and unbreakable.

## 🛡️ Sovereign Features: Your Co-Created Arsenal

These are the core systems we are building together:

### **1. Sandboxed Citadel (The Djed Pillar)**
* **Disposable Sessions**: All history, cookies, and local storage vaporize automatically.
* **The NUKE Button**: Instant, total deletion of your active session.
* **Sandboxed Browsing**: Isolated environment for maximum security.

### **2. Real-Time AI Sentinels (The Scarab Engine)**
* **AI Threat Detection**: Real-time malware and phishing recognition, powered by on-device models.
* **Contextual Advice**: An integrated AI assistant to guide you through security threats.

### **3. Ma'at-Aligned Protection (The Feather of Truth)**
* **Tracker Blocking**: Block all ads, trackers, and surveillance scripts.
* **VPN Integration**: Anonymity layer built into the core.

## 🤝 Contribution: The 14 Sovereign Pathways

Muskskito is a direct manifestation of the Sovereign Pathways. We invite contributors across all 14 disciplines to join the co-creation effort.

| Pathway Skill Set | Project Focus Area | Contribution Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Djed Pillar (Software)** | Immutable Code | Help refine the sandboxing core and Rust security modules. |
| **Scarab (ML Engineers)** | AI Sentinel Models | Work on optimizing and quantizing the threat-detection models for on-device speed. |
| **Reed Pen (Language)** | Agent Prompts | Craft the precise prompts that govern the AI security assistant's advice. |

## 🛠️ Beginner Co-Creation Project: Cartouche-UI Clarity Audit

Our most immediate need is **narrative sovereignty**. We need to translate complex code into plain, powerful truth. This is the perfect entry point for new contributors (Pillars 5 & 8).

### **Goal:** Define the **"Ren"** (True Name) of our features.
Help us write perfect, powerful, one-sentence descriptions for every core security feature.

1.  **Join:** Fork the repository.
2.  **Locate:** Find the `shared/config/messages.yaml` file (or create it!).
3.  **Translate:** Take the current technical description and rewrite it to be clear, emotionally impactful, and strictly aligned with the mission.

| Key | Current Technical Description | Your Proposed Cartouche Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `feature.disposable_sessions` | *Automatically delete browsing history after set time* | **[Contribute your clear, powerful version here]** |
| `feature.ai_threat_detection` | *Real-time malware and phishing detection* | **[Contribute your clear, powerful version here]** |
| `feature.nuke_button` | *NUKE button for instant session termination* | **[Contribute your clear, powerful version here]** |

### **How to Contribute (Getting Started):**

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/aaronalexander666/muskskito.git](https://github.com/aaronalexander666/muskskito.git)
    cd muskskito
    ```
2.  **Open an Issue:** Describe the feature you want to work on (e.g., "Working on Cartouche descriptions for VPN").
3.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Target your changes to the `main` branch.

## 🎨 Tech Stack & Infrastructure

Muskskito is built on a foundation of speed, security, and immutability:

* **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
* **Backend**: Express + tRPC 11
* **Data**: MySQL/TiDB (Scalability)
* **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4
* **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 integration (with plans for self-hosted SLMs)

We use the most modern, maintainable stack to ensure the long-term sovereignty of the project.
